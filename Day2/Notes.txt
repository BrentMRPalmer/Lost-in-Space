Current = Voltage/Resistance

Ex: 
Current = 5 Volts / 220 Ohms
	= 0.023 Amperes

LED stands for light emitting diode

Breadboard provides electrical connections to the
holes in the same row. 
There are also connected holes in vertical lines
in the + and - columns of the breadboard.

LEDs: Electrical current should flow into
the long prong and out of the short prong.

-----------------------------------------------

Making a light turn on:
Must make a full circuit
Connect 5V to breadboard using wire
Connect 220 Ohm resistor on breadboard
Connect breadboard to GND (ground) using wire

-----------------------------------------------

Arduino notes:
Functions can also be called routines
Each line, ended by a semicolon, is called a statement
Comments use // syntax
The setup routine runs once at the start, and then
the loop routine runs continously
