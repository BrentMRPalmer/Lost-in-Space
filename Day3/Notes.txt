Using a switch as one of our discrete components
Called a DIP switch (Dual inline plastic)
Flipping a switch to on "completes" the circuit

--------------------------------------------------

Goal today - instead of using the DIP switch to control the current 
of the light directly, we are using it to control the hero board.

--------------------------------------------------

Why do we need a resistor between the switch and the 
HERO board.
5V straight to ground can short circuit a HERO board.
